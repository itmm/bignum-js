# bignum-js

Small library for doing big integer arithmetic in JavaScript. Only the functions needed for RSA
encryption are implemented.

# First Steps

`bignum.js` is a JS6 module. For the unit-test you must first install webpack (with `npm install`)
and then convert the JavaScript file (with `make`).
